## Instructions for Adding Your Custom Images

Place your custom PNG images in this folder with the following names:

### 1. **bird.png**
- This is the image for your bird character
- Recommended size: 40x40 pixels (or any square size)
- Format: PNG with transparent background (optional)
- The game will automatically load and display this image

### 2. **building.png**
- This is the image for the obstacles (buildings/pipes)
- Recommended size: 60 pixels wide, any height (will be stretched vertically)
- Format: PNG
- This image will be used for both top and bottom obstacles

## How to Add Images:

1. Save your custom bird PNG as: `bird.png`
2. Save your custom building PNG as: `building.png`
3. Place both files in this `assets` folder

## Fallback Graphics:

If you don't add custom images, the game will use simple colored shapes:
- Bird: Yellow rectangle with eye and beak
- Buildings: Brown rectangles

The game will work perfectly fine without custom images, but custom PNGs will make it look much better!

## Image Tips:

- Use transparent backgrounds for the bird for best results
- Keep file sizes small (under 100KB) for faster loading on mobile
- Test on your phone to ensure images look good at different screen sizes
